# R-Type Server Protocol Specification

## Status of this Memo

This document specifies the R-Type Server Protocol for multiplayer game implementation, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

## Abstract

This document describes the protocol and architecture for the R-Type multiplayer game server. The server implements a real-time multiplayer game system using UDP for game state synchronization and player interactions.

## 1. Introduction

The R-Type server implements a multiplayer game server using an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. It handles player connections, game state synchronization, and game logic for the R-Type game.

### 1.1. Terminology

- ECS: Entity Component System
- UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- Entity: A unique identifier for game objects
- Component: Data structures that contain game object properties

## 2. Protocol Overview

### 2.1. Server Configuration

The server operates on a specified UDP port (default: 6000) and supports multiple simultaneous client connections.

### 2.2. Frame Rate

The server maintains a fixed frame rate of 60 FPS (frames per second) for game state updates.

## 3. Server Architecture

### 3.1. Core Components

- GameEngine: Main game logic handler
- Network Server: UDP-based networking system
- Component System: Entity-component management
- Systems: Game logic processors

### 3.2. Game State Management

The server maintains:
- Player positions and states
- Enemy positions and states
- Bullet trajectories and collisions
- Game world state

## 4. Game Components

### 4.1. Core Components

- Transform: Position and scale information
- Velocity: Movement vectors
- CollisionBox: Collision detection boundaries
- Health: Entity health status
- Bullet: Projectile properties

### 4.2. Component Data Structures

```cpp
struct transform {
    float _posx, _posy;
    float _rotation;
    float _scalex, _scaley, _scalez;
};

struct velocity {
    float _velx, _vely;
};
```

## 5. Network Protocol

### 5.1. Message Types

1. createPlayer
2. createBullet
3. playerMove
4. createEnemy
5. destroy
6. resyncPlayer

### 5.2. Message Format

Messages follow a standard format:
```cpp
struct message_header {
    udpProtocol id;
    uint32_t size = 0;
};
```

## 6. Game Systems

### 6.1. Core Systems

1. Position Update System
   - Updates entity positions based on velocity
   - Frequency: Every frame

2. Collision System
   - Handles collision detection and response
   - Types: Player-Enemy, Bullet-Enemy

3. Enemy Spawn System
   - Generates enemies at intervals
   - Configurable spawn rate and positions

### 6.2. Network Synchronization

- Player positions are resynced every 2 frames
- Immediate synchronization for critical events (shooting, destruction)

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1. Input Validation

The server implements:
- Velocity limits (-10 to 10 for both x and y)
- Position boundary checking
- Collision validation

### 7.2. Anti-Cheat Measures

- Server-side validation of all player actions
- Position verification
- Rate limiting for actions

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1. Network Errors

- Connection timeout handling
- Packet loss compensation
- Client disconnection management

### 8.2. Game State Errors

- Entity destruction verification
- Component validation
- System error recovery

## 9. Performance Considerations

### 9.1. Optimization

- Fixed frame rate at 60 FPS
- Efficient collision detection
- Optimized network packet size

### 9.2. Scalability

- Support for multiple simultaneous players
- Dynamic enemy spawning system
- Resource management
