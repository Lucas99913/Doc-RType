## Implementation Impact

### Performance Benefits

```cpp
// Example of ECS implementation in C++
class Registry {
    // Efficient component storage
    std::vector<Component> components;

    // Fast entity management
    void update() {
        for(auto& component : components) {
            // Direct memory access
            component.process();
        }
    }
};
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build process with CMake & Conan
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
cmake ..
make

# Run tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Integration Example

```cpp
// SFML integration with our engine
class RenderSystem {
    sf::RenderWindow& window;

    void render(const SpriteComponent& sprite, 
                const PositionComponent& pos) {
        sf::Sprite spriteObj = sprite.getSprite();
        spriteObj.setPosition(pos.x, pos.y);
        window.draw(spriteObj);
    }
};
```
